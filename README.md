# rChIPSeqTools
R scripts in this package were developed to analyse ChIP-Seq data generated by Stadhouders et al. 2015, Nature communication. There are 2 main functions for these scripts (1) to do peak detection and (2) to generate motif logo from the results of the denovo motif discovery software, MEME (http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme). 

To do the peak detection, the script “sRunPeakDetection.R” have to be executed in the terminal of R statistical software. The script requires BAM files, which can be found in the example.data folder as the input. The script automatically reads in BAM files, detects and splits regions, and assigns statistical values for each detected binding sites. The peak detection will be performed chromosome-by-chromosome basis.
